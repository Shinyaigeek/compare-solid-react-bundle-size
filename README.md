# compare-solid-react-bundle-size

I compare bundle size between app made with solid and app made with react.
I know solid's runtime performance is better than react, but I don't know that it is the same in I/O performance.

## What app ?

Because I want to make blog application, so I prepare the simple application that app fetch data from datastore, and render it(on client side).

## output

* react js file size : 131KB
* solid js file size: 12KB

## How to check

please change webpack.config, babelrc, tsconfig and build
